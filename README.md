# WikiNotes
This is a place that I will use to post interesting information for those who want to know the Dark Side.

* I have found a page that provides news, pages or documents on some fundamentals or topics of interest about hacking, the truth is that I have not been able to dedicate the time to it, I would like to know it in detail, but   it seems good to me to document it in this README.

* How many of us have seen in the repositories of other colleagues a portentous README that makes us think that this person is a pro in Git Hub?
  Turns out it's just "plain text" and easy to learn, I found a page that will teach the basics and that's more than enough. I leave below a small intro topic by the creators of the page.
  >"Markdown is a way to write content for the web. It’s written in what people like to call “plaintext”, which is exactly the sort of text you’re used to writing and seeing. Plaintext is just the regular alphabet, with a 
   few familiar symbols, like asterisks ( * ) and backticks ( ` ).  
 Unlike cumbersome word processing applications, text written in Markdown can be easily shared between computers, mobile phones, and people. It’s quickly becoming the writing standard for academics, scientists, writers, and many more. Websites like GitHub and reddit use Markdown to style their comments.
 Formatting text in Markdown has a very gentle learning curve. It doesn’t do anything fancy like change the font size, color, or type. All you have control over is the display of the text—stuff like making things bold, creating headers, and organizing lists.  
 If you have ten minutes, you can learn Markdown!
In each lesson, you’ll be given an introduction to a single Markdown concept. Then, you’ll be asked to complete several exercises with that new knowledge."
